# PersonalPage

A personal about me page and sandbox for learning and practicing Angular development.  Ths goal is to create data driven components that will draw data from either a database or json files, that will not be committed. 

Is this template is appealing to you, please feel free to use it.

As of right now, unfortunately, there's nothing really to see here. Only the initial application scaffold has been created.
