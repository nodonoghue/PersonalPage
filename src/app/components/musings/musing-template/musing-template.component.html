<p>musing-template works!</p>

<!--Musings, or blog entries will have the following structure-->
<!--Title-->
<!--Subtitle-->
<!--Date written-->
<!--Author and author attributes-->
<!--Paragraph collection--><!--Paragraph header--><!--Pagargaph text-->

<!--Things to look into are markdown parsers that would simplify the above and allow the use of markdown as the entire musing content-->
